\section{Dalitz\-Decay Class List}
Here are the classes, structs, unions and interfaces with brief descriptions:\begin{CompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{\bf{Dalitz\-Chi\-Sq} (Class that generates elimination X$^\wedge$2 contours and minimalist X$^\wedge$2 values, also used as a calculation helper for other classes to retrieve the variances or opening angles of and between particles. Uses the particle structs from the \doxyref{vector\-Factory}{p.}{classvectorFactory} class as the standard for accessing information about the event and particles )}{\pageref{classDalitzChiSq}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\bf{Dalitz\-Smear} (Class that takes in a 4vector and smears it, each vector both smeared and unsmeared is stored locally, and the class requires the particle id to be seperately supplied to the class (where it is also stored locally) )}{\pageref{classDalitzSmear}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\bf{event\-Generator} (Creates unique three particle events in the CM frame and Lab frame )}{\pageref{classeventGenerator}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\bf{Min\-Helper} (Since MINUIT2 cannot be associated with a class when using an algorithm this class reads the .hepevt smeared and unsmeared files similar to \doxyref{vector\-Factory}{p.}{classvectorFactory}. Then populates a particle struct array for use as global variables in the minimization implementation )}{\pageref{classMinHelper}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\bf{Photon\-Helper} (This Class is a helper class for the MINUIT minimization implementation. Its function is to calculate the fit energy and uncertainty for the photon from the values generated by the X$^\wedge$2 minimization in MINUIT )}{\pageref{classPhotonHelper}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\bf{vector\-Factory} (Reads events from a specified file or calls event generator to create a 3 particle event and packages a raw event into a particle struct array )}{\pageref{classvectorFactory}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\bf{vector\-Factory::Particle\-Parameters} (Event particle container )}{\pageref{structvectorFactory_1_1ParticleParameters}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\bf{XYgenerator} (Generates x,y values that govern the properties of the dielectric mass, such that x is the invariant mass of the dielectric system and y is the Energy partition in the CM frame )}{\pageref{classXYgenerator}}{}
\end{CompactList}
